You need a simple posting system for Twitter and Facebook?
You want, once the user is authorized, posting in background?

Just checkout GKPostKit.

- Simple open the project, copy the whole GKPostKit folder to your project.
- Fill out GKPostKitGlobals.h
- Checkout PostKitViewController.m to see how it works.

Have fun ;)
